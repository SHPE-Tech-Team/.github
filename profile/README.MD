The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is a National organization with a main purpose to empower **Hisanics and Latinos** across the United States studying Science, Technology, **Engineering**, or Mathematics. We are UIUC's chapter, focused on providing our members with professional, academic, and personal assistance with workshops, career fairs, mentors, and more! Learn more about our organization [here](https://students.grainger.illinois.edu/shpe/home/)! To get involved, join our [Slack community here](https://join.slack.com/t/shpe-uiuc/shared_invite/zt-2dg63mxaa-5uZB58i6PmPgnbJsJzXL7w)!

SHPE's Technical Team is dedicated to providing members with valuable experience of working on technical projects outside of their coursework, allowing members an opportunity to apply the skills they learn in a way that stands out to employers and most importantly ourselves. Tech Team works on robotics, cadding, and programming related projects to develop a wide variety of skillsets within our members. Feel free to message our technical chair Erick Ayala on Slack or through email at [shpe.uiuc.technicalchair@gmail.com](shpe.uiuc.technicalchair@gmail.com).

This year, the Robotics Team will be trying something new alongside doing what has previously been done in Tech Team. Robotics will continue competing in VEX competitions, with this year's goal being a fully functional **VEX V5 Robot🤖🚗** that can climb, lift, and move. Our plan is to 3D print all parts and compete in the annual Illini Cornfield Clash! Another goal of ours is to compete in EOH's RoboBrawl and create our very own **1lb BattleBot🤖🤜** to take down robots from other RSOs on campus!
