#### Robotics Overview
This year, the Robotics Team will be trying something new alongside doing what has previously been done in Tech Team. Robotics will continue competing in VEX competitions, with this year's goal being a fully functional **VEX V5 Robot🤖🚗** that can climb, lift, and move. Our plan is to 3D print all parts and compete in the annual Illini Cornfield Clash! Another goal of ours is to compete in EOH's RoboBrawl and create our very own **1lb BattleBot🤖🤜** to take down robots from other RSOs on campus!
